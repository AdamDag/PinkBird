## About PinkBird
PinkBird is a web application that offers users the ability to scan the barcode of a product and recieve the Pink Tax associated with projects. As Pink Taxes have become fairly common with the intent to upcharge products marketed towards women, we are choosing to use our skills to fight against gender inequality. 

> You do only live once, and I feel like if I’m able to make a difference on this planet and make it just a little better than I found it, then I’ve done my job. -Bindi Irwin

At PinkBird, we are offering, typically women-identifying, consumers:
- The opportunity to educate themselves on the Pink Tax
- The ability to see firsthand the upcharge of female marketed products versus that of males
- The chance to make educated decisions when purchasing products
- And lastly, for ease, recommendations of products that match what they are looking for at the fraction of the cost
